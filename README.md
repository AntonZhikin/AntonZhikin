👋 Hi, I'm Anton — a backend-focused developer with a passion for building reliable and scalable systems. 

💻 I enjoy working with .NET, C#, PostgreSQL, and modern architectural patterns like Clean Architecture, CQRS, Vertical Slice Architecture, and DDD. I have hands-on experience with building RESTful APIs, handling distributed file storage with MinIO, and writing clean, well-tested code.

🚀 I'm also open to frontend development and have experience building responsive interfaces using React, TypeScript, Vite, and Tailwind CSS.

🛠 I love learning new technologies, writing unit and integration tests with xUnit and FluentAssertions, and working with background jobs via Hangfire.

🤝 I value team collaboration, code quality, and continuous improvement. I believe that great products are built through knowledge sharing, attention to detail, and constant curiosity.
